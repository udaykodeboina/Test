# Markup language
* Markup languages are designed for the processing, definition and presentation of text. 
* The language specifies code for formatting, both the layout and style, within a text file. 
* Languages like HTML, XML and CSS are markup languages. 
 
  >HTML is mainly used to direct how a browser should display some website elements like images, links, tables and things like that. 
 You can take HTML as a webpage layout and presentation description language.
 XML is mainly used to convey text information, and it has such things as tags to indicate the meaning of a piece of information.

# CSV file(comma-separated values):
* CSV is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database.
* Its data fields are most often separated, or delimited, by a comma.
* Files in the CSV format can be imported to and exported from programs that store data in tables,
such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc.

# delimiters:
* A delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters used to specify the boundary between separate, 
independent regions in plain text or other data streams.
* An example of a delimiter is the comma character, which acts as a field delimiter in a sequence of comma-separated values.
* Most database and spreadsheet programs are able to read or save data in a delimited format.
* A delimited text file is a text file used to store data, in which each line represents a single book,
 company, or other thing, and each line has fields separated by the delimiter. 

  > Any character may be used to separate the values, but the most common delimiters are the comma, tab, and colon.[1]:113[4]
The vertical bar (also referred to as pipe) and space are also sometimes used.
[1]:113 In a comma-separated values (CSV) file the data items are separated using commas as a delimiter,
 while in a tab-separated values (TSV) file, the data items are separated using tabs as a delimiter.

* For example, the following fields in each record are delimited by commas

   Ex: "Date","Pupil","Grade"
